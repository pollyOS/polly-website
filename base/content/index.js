Polly is a protocol for creating, deploying and configuring reusable smart contract modules in custom configurations directly on-chain. The framework makes it easier and cheaper to deploy code to the Ethereum blockchain. Polly is (1) OPEN for all to use and build on through an (2) EXTENDABLE architecture. The Polly core, all module versions and configurations are (3) PERMANENT once deployed.

export const open = <>
The projects and protocols of the future must be accesible and open to all and so must the tools with which they are build. We've built Polly to ensure access for everyone by making the foundational access points fully permissionless.
</>

export const extendable = <>
The modular approach enables mix and match between Polly modules and custom contracts outside the framework.
</>

export const permanent = <>
The Polly core is a non-upgradeable smart contract that stores references to modules and configruations. Once a module is added to the library it can't be removed or changed and will forever be accesible.
